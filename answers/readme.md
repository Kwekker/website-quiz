# The answer directory
This is where all answer json files are located! Except, there's only one file!!! How could this have happened???

This is the case, because I don't want people snooping around here just grabbing all the answers to the questions themselves, of course!! That would be dumb and also quite stupid. That's why I've decided to put all answer files into the .gitignore! I purposefully kept the answer file for the free points question available for you to read, as an example of how answer files are structured. The file is longer than it has to be; I kinda lost track of what I was doing and made a small text based adventure game of that question.
