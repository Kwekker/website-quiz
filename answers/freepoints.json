The spacebar is usually a very large rectangle at the bottom of your keyboard. Just press that, and type \"off\". Next, you are going to hit the 'enter' key (also commonly reffered to as the 'return' key) on your keyboard.<br>You could also type \"fliepfloep\" as the answer, if this is too hard for you."
